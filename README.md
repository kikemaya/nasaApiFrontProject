# nasa-api-front-project
This is just another NASA API project. I've to practice, right?

#Install the dependencies just using:
npm install

#Install browserify(global and in your project):
npm install -g browserify
npm i browserify

#create a bundle.js every time you make any change on the js file. I'll automate this in the future. But while that happen, just follow this, please:
cd ./js
browserify index.js > bundle.js

That's it. Enjoy and break everthing u want.
